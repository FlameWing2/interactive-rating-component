## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

The things this project taught me are how to implement animations with CSS and how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript. Adding or removing classes and using atributes to condition different functions is something I have never done before and I was worried about what kind of attributes we could use or remove without having a huge impact on the HTML. 


### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - This helped me a lot about how to create animations in CSS and how to implement them.
